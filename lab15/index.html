	<h1>Lab 15: Fancy CSS 1</h1>
	<p>The idea if this lab was to change the position and the block style of the page/elements.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>The most challenging part for me was trying to create the css file from scratch</p>
	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p>Overall I am satisfied with what I was able to accomplish. However I did not like how I had to use the css file frovided in lab 6.</p>
