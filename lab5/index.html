	<h1>Lab 5: More HTML</h1>
	<p>The idea if this lab was to create a webpage with images and links to other pages</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>The most challenging part for me was trying to resize the images so that they didnâ€™t take up a large screen real estate.</p>
	<h3>Results</h3>
	<p>Overall I am satisfied with what I was able to accomplish. I finally figured out how to make my images appear and learned how to embed a link to an image.</p>
